# python_sync_folder

**Working: enough for me**


Python script to download a folder from a server, then upload it, via SSH (submodule).


First create a filed called 'config.cfg' with the following (file not included for obvious reasons):


ADDRESS=localhost
PORT=22
USERNAME=username
PASSWORD=password
REMOTE_WORKING_DIR=/home/username/Desktop/
REMOTE_TARGET_DIR=remote_folder
